Reflection 10:
The fact that structure is necessary to cultivate motivation became very apparent this week. With the creation of a task list,
github exploded with issues, people communicate with each other on a daily basis. Why? They know exactly what they should focus
on, and that sparked the drive all Berkeley students have within themselves to serve a task to completion.
However, I have also seen some issues arise out of this. Since some students saw that the "leadership group" was leading the
class, they have resisted the shift in authority by turning it into a power struggle. Certain students have taken up leadership
roles that have complemented our plans quite well, but there are others who have created their own schedules in order to compete
with the timeline we made. This only causes confusion and in effect, adds negative value.
Right now, I see the next step as being sharing knowledge effectively. Even though most students are going great work, everyone
is avoiding the main problem that no one really understands, how to improve the simple stark model. To me, it makes complete
sense; with grades on the line, everyone wants to have tangible contributions documented and no one wants to fail. To combat
this, I am collaborating with Carl to create an informative slideshow about earthquakes, hoping to instill more confidence in
the class in terms of tackling the additional parameters. We plan to ask specialists on the Berkeley campus to supplement our
research.
I am also working on aggregating all of the presentation information onto some readable digital file so everyone can go back to
it in case they were confused at any point, and those who are experts can add to it.
