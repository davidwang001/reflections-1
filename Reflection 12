Reflection 12
For this reflection, I find myself, for the first time in this class, not knowing what to write at all. Aaron mentioned that we
were going to pivot from the main project, but I am unsure of what that meant. What is our objective now? 
I know that our group specifically should be making our own assignments and understanding where the class is going, but with the
Luen call not providing a definitive place to continue searching for answers, I think the part of the class more involved in the
model could not move forward as quickly as we had all hoped.
I understand that the class is about redefining how we approach data science, stressing reproducibility and defensibility. I
look forward to seeing smaller assignments that tie these concepts together as the class comes to an end. I also look forward to
a more dynamic 157 class the next semester.
