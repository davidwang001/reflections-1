Reflection 5:
I like where the class is going, I can tell that we are about to make some real progress. I am assuming the point of the
specialized group projects is to unveil difficulties associated with randomized teams and to encourage collaboration across
both horizontal and vertical groups in order to solve these issues. I am pretty excited to see this one through, how my
classmates and I will overcome various inefficiencies and how horizontal groups will make use of a specialized network. So far,
there are a lot of things going on so it is a bit worrisome.
I think that in a classroom setting, a better method of doing this is having EVERYONE be a data curator, then having EVERYONE
be an analyzer, and so on. This way, no one has to wait on others, and when they have problems they can seek out help from their
friends in the class who are more willing to teach than a newly acquainted classmate. Also, it would be really helpful to have
guidelines on how to extract data and analyze it. It doesn't have to be obvious answers, but statements that would get us asking
the right questions and thinking in the correct direction. Most programming classes give a backbone program where certain
functions have been started and variables defined.
Roadblocks: I don't know where the best tutorials are for these new tools, and it is getting overwhelming going over all the
resources given to us recently. I have no idea what kind of capabilities iPython contains; a demo of how to get started would
have been awesome. Ultimately, I feel like there are 10 times going on at once, and I feel like no clear vision of what the end
product is. It is becoming pretty high stress, hopefully tomorrow's office hours can relieve some of that stress.
