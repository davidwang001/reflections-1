Reflection 11:
I decided to finish this reflection after having our leadership group meeting on Sunday. 
Summarizing the past week: I really do not think much got done last week, and it seems more apparent that everyone is on
different spectrums of understanding. I can see that Teresa’s group is making strides on testing the MDA model against the ETAS
model, but even then momentum is slowing there. As for other groups, nothing is being churned out and lack of direction has once
again hindered productivity. The major roadblock is that we cannot possibly understand these models without simplification from
Professor Luen or Professor Stark. Using Chris’s presentation, our group will try to create a detailed deliverable this weekend
to fix this issue so that more ideas can flow, and the ability to test errors will become a relevant tool.
I believe the Stand-Ups aren’t very helpful anymore as goals have become much less defined. Instead, a system where volunteers
can present any significant findings could be much more helpful and time friendly. If GSIs could set daily class goals, that
would be really helpful too, even if it is to talk within groups and come up with a game plan or finish evaluations, because at
least the entire group is collaborating instead of making things up on google docs, etc. How to use class time in the best
possible way is still cloudy to me, but hopefully I will have an answer for you soon.
Sunday’s Meeting: Today’s meeting was great, we made a timeline that gave us a good amount of direction as to where we are
going next. We feel like the next step is to get everyone to understand the ETAS and MDA models. To facilitate this, we will
make a deliverable using notes on Luen’s paper and Chris’ presentation. Afterwards, the class can hopefully make some
improvements to the MDA model in big ways.
