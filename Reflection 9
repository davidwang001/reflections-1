Reflection #9:
I would say this week was much different from any other week of stat 157. The idea of collaboration became much more apparent as
we delved into a project that incorporates the entire class, rather than these 4 person verticals. I witnessed first-hand
analyzers and presenters going to office hours as a horizontal group and churning out ideas about the project. I stepped into
office hours on Friday as analyzers were finishing up. Together, we went over the objectives of the class and narrowed down the
kinds of questions we need to ask each other. Together as a vertical group, we bucketed these questions, which means we organized
them into groups that individual groups can tackle. We did this in an effort to accelerate the process and make effective
deadlines for this project. This will help our class get as much done as possible with the time we have left.
In addition to class related collaboration, our team redefined the concept of academic teams by getting to know each other on a
more personal basis. We had a working lunch earlier today at Asian Pearl Dim Sum. It was great to get away from the pressures
associated with Berkeley's structured academic system, and to enjoy the presence of others for what it is. It was a great team
bonding experience that has given us a foot forward by allowing us to understand each other's skills, personalities, and
obligations. As I write this reflection, I am sitting in a cafe with Tristan, Tim, and Reena. I have learned that collaboration
transcends the preconception of exploiting complementary skill sets to achieve a common goal, and includes creating a natural
affinity towards each other that encourages the entire group to move forward as one unit, no matter what the overarching
objective is.
