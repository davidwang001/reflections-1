Reflection #2:
  I thought that the last lecture we made a lot of progress as a group. There was definitely some tension as to how the class
wanted to move forward. I am glad we had a communication session that resolved some underlying issues, such as lack of tangible
guidelines and fragmented communication channels. I think by using bspace as a primary medium for outgoing messages and github
for inflow, there will be less confusion. Before I go into more problems and proposed solutions, I will review some weekly
roadblocks.

	For roadblocks, I had trouble remembering how to post on Github. It shows the usefulness of reproducible data, which in this
sense, would save me a lot of time. My steps were as follows:

1. Find the correct repository for submitting on the stat 157 profile
2. Fork that repository
3. Edit that version on Github using the github flavored markup
4. When writing, make sure to skip lines or use a text editor like sublime text so the words are parsed nicely for reading
*problems with sublime text: starting with a large blob of text, I tried every tab and subtab to find out if any of them, but
no luck. Google searches were difficult to filter and frequently brought up tutorials on formatting text on computer code rather
than pure text.
5. After the markdown is complete, save the edits by giving them a title and hitting submit edits.
6. File a pull request so that the instructor can view your reflection.

	  For the coming weeks, I would highly appreciate guides on sublime text, github, and ipython so I can have study materials for
	personal reading at convenient times. To facilitate the learning process, student groups should set reading goals collectively
	and make sure no group members fall behind within each group. With these implementations, I am confident that the class will
	be much more organized and the learning process will be accelerated.
	  Finally, I completely forgot about the reflection until now, and I think such instances could be avoided through two simple
	plugs. First, we could be handed a weekly syllabus outlining assignments due and material covered. Second, the bspace page
	should be utilized more in terms of sending out weekly announcements and posting relevant materials, both from instructors
	and students.
