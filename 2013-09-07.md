Reflection #1:
This class has definitely been challenging for me because I have had little experience with computers and interacting with the Tech world. However, what interests me so much about the class is the vast learning potential and passion that exists within both the students and instructors.
This past week, I've encountered a few problems. First off, I could not download Ubuntu, which Aaron resolved for me using micro torrent. In addition, I forgot my password for Virtual Box, so in class I instead took notes on the steps required to install iPython notebook. I have attached the file I used in class to this reflection. To solve my missing password problem, Aaron told me to reinstall the virtual machine, which worked. This time, I wrote my password down on a separate document to make sure I don't run into the same problem again.
In addition, I was confused about certain technical definitions as well, like pull requests and the purpose of virtual machine. For pull requests, Aaron was kind enough to draw me a diagram of how it worked during office hours: basically, pull requests are how secondary users can request to add their personal changes into the master copy after forking it via Github. I educated myself on the uses of virtual box using a simple Google search that referred me to several forums and Wikipedia. I read the emulated environment section in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox.
While trying to submit this document, I found it possible using these steps: First, clone the reflections repo you created in class. Next, drag the document you want into your local reflections repo. Synch the two repositories and the process should be complete.
In terms of how the class is going so far, I like the pace of it, namely how it adjusts based on where everyone is. I would suggest a weekly discussion section sometime on Friday where students who fall behind can work together and with the instructor to catch up. That way, every lecture, all the students will be on the same page and able to get through more material. This makes sense because I noticed that the majority of our class is on freenode during class time only, so having an official discussion would facilitate communication. Students would save time by having others to bounce their problems off of, and instructors would save time because they can hold less office hours.
I look forward to what we will learn in the coming weeks, and I plan to ask and answer more questions so that I can share my experiences with those having the same problems. So far, I really enjoy this class and what it pledges to teach us.
