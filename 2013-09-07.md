Reflection #3:
The set of speakers was definitely a unique twist on the usual. I was very interested in hearing what they had to say about
their own research and how statistics could be applied to everyday life. I especially enjoyed the presentation on toad
conservation research. It clearly identified what the point of the research and field studies were trying to do and how the
team went about carrying out their objective. It was extremely organized and gave the class a sense of what reproducible data
entailed. For the two presentations, I would have liked more time to take in the information. Having hazy knowledge of stat
134 and being currently enrolled in stat 135, it was difficult to follow the statistical portions of each presentation,
especially Professor Stark's. I was completely lost when talking about the tests used in the rat experience, as well as for
measuring earthquake data. Nonetheless, both were absolutely fantastic speakers and I am glad to have a class that focuses more
on practical aspects of statistics rather than completely on theoretical aspects. 
As for roadblocks not listed above, most carried over from last week, which is understandable given Aaron is out of town. Just
to rename some of them: written guidelines, and supplementary homework to get everyone on track, and better communication whether it be through a facebook group of discussion sections. I am also having a lot of trouble figuring out exactly how to submit on Github, I have been trying to send a pull request from the stat 157 repo for the past 3 hours. Oddly, my reflection from last week is gone and I am at a stone and a hard place in terms of how to submit. 
Finally, Professor Stark hinted at our final project, so I am excited to be able to work towards an end goal that could prove
to be an extremely rewarding experience. For now, I am eagerly awaiting changes in the next week.
