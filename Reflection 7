Reflection #7:
What stood out to me this week were the roadblocks I ran into while doing the second homework. First of all, I have a midterm
this coming Monday that is worth a hefty portion of my grade. I needed to start early on the statistics project if I wanted to
have time Sunday for studying; this meant that I did not have a chance to gain direction during office hours. Understanding some
of the concepts, such as caching the data and using JSON, was extremely difficult with no one to ask. However, this made me turn
to the issue tracker which helped a great amount. I learned from others how to set up python libraries to prepare me for data
curation. Also, I used my notebook from a previous cs class to help me generalize the plotting portion of the assignment. In
addition, our most proficient coder, Tristan, left the group on Friday and left us between a rock and a hard place. This project
is pretty heavy on knowing what to do in terms of coding, so it is definitely a big deal for our group. I took on many more
responsibilities since I knew a bit about coding in python and Bonghyun is taking a technical lead. I am really glad that I have
a chance to code more, since that was one of the reasons I took this class in teh first place. Finally, knowing all of the
roadblocks I ran into before actually coming to office hours allowed me to ask more concise questions and get to the answers I
needed quicker than when I came in for OH for the first project. Hopefully as I move forward, these lessons accumulate into
efficient working habits.
I also heard that Professor Stark is changing the prospect of our final project. I like the idea of tweaking a simplistic model
to get results that compare with complex models. I was unable to attend class on Thursday, but from what I heard it seems like
a cool project.
